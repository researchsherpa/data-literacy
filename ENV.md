# Notes on the env

I use jupyter lab with folium, ipywidgets, ipyleaflet, bqplot, and qgrid. Here's a simple recipe to set it up from scratch.  

  1. Make sure Anaconda is installed and `git lfs clone` the repository from github.  cd into the data-literacy folder.  
  
  2. In the data-literacy folder you should see the environment.yml file.  Use this to build the env using conda:  `conda env create -f environment.yml`
  
  3. Once the create env is completed, activate the new env: `conda activate data-literacy`
  
  4. Now that you're in the data-literacy env,  set up the js packages with: `jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager jupyter-leaflet bqplot`
  
  5. At this point you will have a working jupyter lab with the necessary widgets.  Launch the lab with `juptyer lab`.
  
  6. You're ready to explore, understand, develop, ...
